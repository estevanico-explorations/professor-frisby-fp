# professor-frisby-fp
Code from "Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript"

Playlist is located here: https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript

## About
This is supplimental to the egghead.io course. Each lesson directory has a readme with my own thoughts to each lesson. Student's notes if you will. It's in a `README.md` so you'll see it as soon as you click into each lesson. The code itself is run as a series of tests though `package.json`. Run the code to see each iteration.

## Other FP Projects
I'm always trying to get better at Functional Programming and I want to go through this course to learn more about it as I'm trying to strengthen my foundation. I am also, very slowly, putting together a guide to functional programming with it's own code as well. You can find that here: 

* [Documentation](https://mrpotatoes.github.io/functional-programming-in-js-reference)
* [Repo](https://github.com/mrpotatoes/functional-programming-in-js-reference)
