## [Capture Side Effects in a Task](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-capturing-side-effects-in-a-task)
This is empty because this is essentially the same as LazyBox lesson except using a real API.

So [go back to Lesson 11](https://github.com/mrpotatoes/professor-frisby-fp/tree/master/lessons/lesson11) and make sure you understand that. The main difference, other than `data.task` can be used in production, is the use of `.fork()` instead of `.fold()`.

Hey, also, note how this looks a bunch like a `Promise()`. Cuz it basically is but things aren't immediately run. Which is good.
